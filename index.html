        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. 
        Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, 
        and entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:</p>
        
        <blockquote>“Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
        I think of it as the gift of knowledge... and that is priceless.”</blockquote>

        <h2>Our Ticket Packages</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Season Package: $95</li>
            <li>Patron Package: $200</li>
            <li>Single Speaker: $25</li>
